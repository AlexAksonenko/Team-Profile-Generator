# Team-Profile-Generator
The objective for this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, and with that information generates an HTML webpage that displays the user input data. One requirement of the application was to make use of Constructors and Classes to create the employee objects. Among these were the Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. In addition to building the application, this project also required the use of Jest and Inquirer to conduct unit tests of every part of the code to ensure that it would pass each test.
